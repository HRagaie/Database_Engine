To insert in BPlustTree insert method is called ( line 314 ). 
The root is deserialized (line 315).
InsertValue method is invoked on the root (line 316). 
By recursion all children are invoked on insertValue (line 598 & 599)

Our convention for naming the internal node files: "index_On_" + "ColName+" + "tableName" +"(value of first key in node)"+I.txt"
Our convention for naming the leaf node files: "index_On_" + "ColName+" + "tableName" +"(value of first key in node)"+L.txt"
Our convention for naming the root node files: "index_On_" + "ColName+" + "tableName" +"root"+.txt";

Parents reference children nodes by calling their corresponding saved nodes on disk 
depending on the convention previously described (node by node when needed is loaded)

To delete in BPlusTree delete method is called (line 356)
The root is deserialize (line 357)
The deleteValue method is called on the root(line 358)
By recursion deleteValue is invoked on all children (line 507)
When a node is changed through any of the above described processes,
it's file is deleted and then recreated with the above convention


We follow same approach for RTrees with the same method signatures
